# Project Noodle Raptor
My personal project for practicing data structures and algorithms.

## Python
I followed along with my Python Data Structures book by implementing each data structure from every chapter.

## Swift
I'm also a fan of iOS development so I will attempt to implement the same data structures and algorithms inside of Swift.
